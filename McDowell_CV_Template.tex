		\begin{cvsubsection}{DEEP MEME Secure Messaging Android App}{}{Senior Project}
			Encrypted messages embedded into image files enables private message sharing in innocuous memes: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Uses RSA encryption algorithm and 2048-bit public/private key pairs.
				\item Android KeyStore creates and manages private key (the app can use the key but not read it).
				\item Open source steganographic algorithm to embed the message into the image file.
				\item Public keys are easily shared in person via QR-code or via URL/URI.
				\item Used SQLite database to store friendly public keys acquired from scanned QR codes.
			\end{itemize}
