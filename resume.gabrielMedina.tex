		\begin{cvsubsection}{\emph{deep meme} Secure Messaging Android App}{Senior Project}
			Encrypted messages embedded into image files enables private message sharing through memes: 
			\begin{itemize}[topsep=-3pt]
				\item Uses RSA encryption algorithm and 2048-bit public/private key pairs
				\item Private key is managed at the system level and can't be exposed (Android KeyStore)
				\item Open source steganographic algorithm to embed the message into the image file
				\item Used SQLite database to store friendly public keys acquired from scanned QR codes
				\item Public keys are easily shared in person via QR-code or online via URL/URI
			\end{itemize}
